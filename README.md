**Describtion:** Approximation of PFR reactor system using *n* CSTRs in series. Output product concentration is controlled using PID controller. This project was implemented as a final project for CHG3335 <br>
**Fles:** This git includes problem describtion, report file along with excel sheet simulation and TypeScript code of addin that was written for this project. <br>
